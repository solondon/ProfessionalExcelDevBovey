Application for Chapter 24 - Excel & VB.NET

**************************** PETRAS Report Tool .NET ****************************

If you are running the application with a version of Excel other than Excel 2003, 
you first need to change the references to the Excel object library, Office object 
library and Microsoft Visual Basic for Application Extensibility 5.3 object library,
as this is not done automatically.

In order to explore and test the application you will need to meet the following
requirements.

* Excel 2003 SP-3 or later.
* Visual Studio 2008 or later.
* SQL Server 2005 Express Edition or later.

Attach the PETRAS database to SQL Server.

1. Unzip the PETRAS_Database.zip file. This archive contains two files:
   PETRAS.mdf and PETRAS.ldf.
2. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
3. Expand the node for your SQL Server in the Object Explorer window.
4. Right-click on the Databases folder and choose "Attach..." from the menu.
5. In the attach databases dialog click the Add button.
6. Locate the PETRAS.mdf file and click OK in both dialogs to attach the database.

Update the connection string.

1. Open VS 2008.
2. Open PETRAS Project file located in the  mainfolder \PETRAS Report Tool .NET.
3. Select the command Project | PETRAS Report Tool .NET Properties...
4. Select the tab 'Settings'.
5. Select the value field for the SQLConnection and click on the '...' button.
6. Entry the correct information in the dialog form:

- If you use a local SQL Server 2005 Express Edition or later, for the 
  'Server name' start with a \ [backslash] and then the name SQLEXPRESS.
- Select the 'Windows Authentication' option for logging into the server.
- Select PETRAS database in the field 'Select or enter a database name'.
- Make sure to test the connection by clicking the 'Test Connection' button.

Even if you only want to run the solution you still need to meet the above requirements
and also change the connection string in the following way:

1. Open the XML configuration file 'PETRAS Report Tool .NET.exe.xml' which can be found in the folder: 
...\Ch 24 - Excel & VB.NET\Applications\PETRAS Report Tool .NET\PETRAS Report Tool .NET\bin\Release
2. Change the connection string.
3. Save the file.
4. Run the executable PETRAS Report Tool.NET exe file.

All the Excel template files are located in the debug folder:

...\PETRAS Report Tool .NET\PETRAS Report Tool .NET\bin\Debug

The help file, PETRAS_Report_Tool.chm, is also located in the Debug folder.

If you run the solution from the compiled exe file in the Release folder or create
a setup package, make sure these files are also included.
