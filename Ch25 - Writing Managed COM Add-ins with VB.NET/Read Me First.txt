Applications for Chapter 25 - Writing Managed COM Add-ins with VB.NET

************************** Office2003PIA *********************************************

With this folder and its files we can add the Office 2003 PIA to the Prerequisites 
dialog and use them with our solutions.

This folder and its files must be placed in the following directory on your computer:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages

When the setup packages are compiled, the following error message will be reported:

"No 'HomeSite' attribute has been provided for 'Microsoft Office 2003 Primary Interop
Assemblies', so the package will be published to the same location as the bootstrapper."

This error message can be disregarded.

A subfolder with the name Office<version>PIA will always be copied to the setup folder
in the solution.


******************** Attach the PETRAS database to SQL Server ************************

If you have not already sttached the PETRAS database to your SQL Server you must do so
using the following steps:

1. Unzip the PETRAS_Database.zip file. This archive contains two files:
   PETRAS.mdf and PETRAS.ldf.
2. Open SQL Server Management Studio.
3. Expand the node for your SQL Server in the Object Explorer window.
4. Right-click on the Databases folder and choose "Attach..." from the menu.
5. In the attach databases dialog click the Add button.
6. Locate the PETRAS.mdf file and click OK in both dialogs to attach the database.



****************** Managed COM Add-in PETRAS Report Tool .NET Excel 2003 ***************

If you are running the application with a version of Excel other than Excel 2003, 
you first need to change the references to the Excel object library, Office object 
library and Microsoft Visual Basic for Application Extensibility 5.3 object library,
as this is not done automatically.

If the Install option is unavailable, you need to first build the setup project and 
then install the solution.

In order to explore and test the application you will need to meet the following
requirements.

* Excel 2003 SP-3 or earlier.
* Visual Studio 2008 or later.
* SQL Server 2005 Express Edition or later.

To update the connection string:

Remove the current connection string:
1. Open VS 2008.
2. Open the PETRAS Project file located in the folder \PETRAS Report Tool
3. Select the Project > PETRAS Report Tool Properties... menu
4. Select the 'Settings' tab.
5. Select the whole first row and right click it. Select Remove Setting from the menu.

Create a new connection string:
1. Choose Data > Add New Data Sources... from the menu
2. In the Data Sources window click the Add New Data Source... button
3. Select the Database option in the first step of Data Source Configuration wizard.
4. In the next step click the New Connection button. 
5. Enter the correct information in the dialog:

- If you use a local SQL Server 2005 Express Edition or later, for the 
  'Server name' start with a \ [backslash] and then the name SQLEXPRESS.
- Select the 'Windows Authentication' option for logging into the server.
- Select PETRAS database in the field 'Select or enter a database name'.
- Make sure to test the connection by clicking the 'Test Connection' button.

All the Excel templates files are located in the bin folder:

...\PETRAS Report Tool\PETRAS Report Tool\bin\

The help file, PETRAS_Report_Tool.chm, is also located in the bin folder.

Important:
If you debug the solution and load Excel then the VS IDE creates a new DLL for the solution
which is loaded by the mscoree.dll file and not the shim. 

To restore so that the shim loads the solution you need to do the following:
1. Uninstall the current version of the solution.
2. Rebuild the setup package.
3. Re-install the solution.

If you see an item with the name "(unable to determine name)" under the PETRASReportToolSetup 
root node in the Solution Explorer then you need to take the following action.

1. Select the "(unable to determine name)" item, right click it and select Remove from the menu.
2. Select the root node PETRASReportToolSetup and right click on it.
3. Select the Add > Project Output... from the menu.
4. In the dialog select the ManagedAggregator in the Project combobox and then click the OK button.

Now you can rebuild the setup package and install the solution.
