<h2>Tools Included on This CD</h2>

<h3>Excel Utilities</h3>

<p>There are several great development utilities available for
the VBE, but the Excel Utilities is the only comprehensive add-in aimed at
Excel user interface development. The Excel Utilities provides a set of 30
features that you'll use on a daily basis. These utilities greatly simplify
numerous activities involving defined names, worksheets, shapes and application
settings, as well as including some nifty shortcuts and selection tools.</p>

<h3>.NET Co Library</h3>

<p>The utility makes it easy to save and reuse all kind of VBA code by storing the code
well organized in a database. It provides a GUI to save and reuse all stored
information. It can also via wizards create and store connection strings which also
can be accessed and reused in an easy way.</p>

<h3>Performance Monitor</h3>

<p>The PerfMon utility is a set of three DLLs, used to measure the performance
on VBA code. By using this tool during the development process, we can optimize
the performance of our code. See <i>Chapter 17 - Optimizing VBA Performance</i>
for more details.</p>

<h3>Smart Indenter</h3>

<p>The Smart Indenter is a utility to tidy up VBA code by
rebuilding the indentation of each line. Most developers naturally indent code
within control structures, such as For...Next, If...End If, etc. Many
developers also indent all the code within a procedure, to ease identification
of line labels, error handling blocks etc. From that point on, there is much
more variety in indenting styles, ranging from how to treat declaration lines
to handling end-of-line comments. The CD includes versions for the Office
2000-2003 VBE and Visual Basic 6. More information about the Smart Indenter can
be found at <a href="http://www.oaltd.co.uk/Indenter">www.oaltd.co.uk/Indenter</a>.</p>

<h3>VBA Code Cleaner</h3>

<p>During the process of creating VBA programs a lot of junk
code builds up in your files. If you don't clean your files periodically you
will begin to experience strange problems caused by this extra baggage.
Cleaning a project involves exporting the contents of all its VBComponents to
text files, deleting the components and then importing the components back from
the text files.</p>

<h3>VBE Tools</h3>

<p>The VBE Tools adds a number of enhancements to the Office
2000-2003 VBE, each of which can be individually enabled in the About dialog.
