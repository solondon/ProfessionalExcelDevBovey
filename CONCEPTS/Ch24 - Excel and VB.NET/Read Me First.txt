Concepts for Chapter 24 - Excel & VB.NET

********************** First Application **********************
It's not required to have VS 2008 in order to run the solution 
but you must have .NET Framework 2.0 or later installed.

The executable file for First Application is located in the 
following folder:

\First Application\First Application\bin\Debug


********************** Automate Excel **********************
It's not required to have VS 2008 in order to run the solution 
but you must have .NET Framework 2.0 or later installed together
with Excel 2003 or later and the version-specific PIA.

If you are running the application with a later version of Excel 
then you first need to change the references to the Excel object 
library, Office object library and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
Extensibility 5.3 object library as this is not done automatically.

Also be sure to change the option "Start external program" under 
the Debug tab in the solution's properties windows.

The executable file for Automate Excel is located in the 
following folder:

Automate Excel\Automate Excel\bin\Debug


********************** Northwind **********************
To run the solution you will need to meet the following
requirements. 

* Visual Studio 2008 or later.
* SQL Server 2005 Express Edition or later.

To run the solution the Northwind database must be connected to
a SQL Server. The instructions to do so are provided in Chapter
19 - Programming with Access and SQL Server. 

The database is available in the main folder:

\NorthWind

You may also need to change the connection string in the two
functions in the MData code module that is included in the solution.
