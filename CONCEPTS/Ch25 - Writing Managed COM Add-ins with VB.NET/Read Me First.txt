Concepts for Chapter 25 - Writing Managed COM Add-ins with VB.NET

If you are running the application with a later version of Excel than
Excel 2003 you first need to change the references to the Excel object 
library, Office object library and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
Extensibility 5.3 object library as this is not done automatically.

If you experience several references to the Microsoft Visual Basic for 
Application Extensibility 5.3 object library in a solution then you should 
remove both. A reference is automatically added to this library when we add a 
reference to Excel object library. However, since none of the solutions
actually use this library you can safely remove all references to it.

Also make sure to change the option "Start external
program" under the Debug tab in the solution's Properties
windows.

If the Install option is unavailable then you need
to first build the setup project and then install the
solution.
